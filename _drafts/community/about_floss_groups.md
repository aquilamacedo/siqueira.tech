## The FLUSP experience

Between 2018 and 2019 I helped to create a FLOSS group named "FLOSS at USP" (FLUSP) in the University of Sao Paulo (USP); when we devised this group we had five founders members: Giuliano, Matheus, Renanto, Marcelo, and I. Everyone had something different in mind, but we share the same goal: spread the desire of technically contribute to free software projects. During our time at USP we noticed a lack of engagement from professors and students with free software and real-world code, and we wish to make USP name become part of glarger projects such as Linux Kernel, GCC, and Git. We worked really hard for ourganize ourselves and start the group, and I can say that we changed a lot of things in the computer science department; you can see some of the achievements of the group in the list below:

Aside from the success that we achieved, we also faced a lot of problems, specially for engage new members. We tried to take advantage of programs that aim to foster free software with undergrade students such as Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and Outreachy. We noticed that many people got intrested and we always tried to help anyone that asked for help, however, after a year of experience with FLUSP I can say that we failed to bring new people to FLOSS community. This situation made me slow my road for a while for trying to reflect about things that could be improved for make independent FLOSS groups in Brazil to flourish; maybe the ideas discussed here can be extended to a different countries.

## In my view, the problem with GSoC and Outreachy

GSoC and Outreachy are great programs for trying to engage newcomers in the community since it provide three fundamental elements:
1. An specific object to achieve in three months
2. Someone for providing guidance
3. A scholarship
