I am a Software Engineering and currently pursue Master Degree in Computer
Science at the University of Sao Paulo. My research interests gravitate around
OS, FLOSS, and Software Engineering.

I am passionate about Operating Systems (OS) field, for me, OS is one of the
human most significant achievements. As a result, I am dedicating many hours of
my life trying to understand this area and contributing to GNU/Linux.
