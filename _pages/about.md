I have a B.S in Software Engineering and M.S in Computer Science at the
University of SÃ£o Paulo. My research interests gravitate around OS, FLOSS, and
Software Engineering.

I am passionate about Operating Systems (OS) field, for me, OS is one of the
human most significant achievements. As a result, I am dedicating many hours of
my life trying to understand this area and contributing to GNU/Linux. If you
want to know more about me, please take a look at the bottom of this page.
