## About this logbook (site/blog)

A logbook is a recorded book that has details of a trip made by a ship or
aircraft. I love this concept, and I adopt it in my life. This site is my open
logbook in which I describe some of the operation and approaches I take in my
daily life as a software engineering.

Here you can find the logbook of my long journey into the OS realm and other
computer science areas. The tutorials published here have been prepared to the
best of my knowledge. It may be possible that they do not work or work
differently than described. Use them at your own risk. I do not accept any
liability for consequential damages. Finally, I check the content of all
external pages. I provide links too, but the operators of the linked pages are
solely responsible for their content.
