## About this logbook (site/blog)

Logbooks are an unstructured text which we explain operations, and approaches
taken by us to finish the work; in a nutshell, it is an analogy with navigation
of a ship. I like this idea and continuously use it in my life, and this site
represents a materialization of this concept.

Here you can find the logbook of my long journey into the OS studies and
others. I describe here, technical and non-technical (rarely) things related to
computer science (especially OS). Keep in mind, that I made this logbook for
me.
