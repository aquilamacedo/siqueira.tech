I have a B.S in Software Engineering
([University of Brasilia](https://international.unb.br/)) and an M.S in
Computer Science ([University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/)). My research
interests gravitate around Operating Systems (OS), FLOSS, Graphics, and
Software Engineering.

OS has a special place in my heart, which means I enjoy learning and teaching
about this topic. As a result, I dedicated many hours of my life to
understanding this area and contributing to GNU/Linux. If you want to know more
about me, please take a look at the bottom of this page.
